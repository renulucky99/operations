# Input for principal amount
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))

# Input for rate of interest
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest per annum: "))

# Input for time in years
time = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Output the calculated simple interest
print(f"{simple_interest:.1f}")
