# Input number of extras
no_balls = int(input("Enter number of No-balls: "))
wides = int(input("Enter number of Wides: "))
byes = int(input("Enter number of Byes: "))
leg_byes = int(input("Enter number of Leg-byes: "))
penalty = int(input("Enter number of Penalty runs: "))

# Calculate total extras
total_extras = (no_balls * 1) + (wides * 1) + (byes * 1) + (leg_byes * 1) + (penalty * 5)

# Output the total extras
print(total_extras)
